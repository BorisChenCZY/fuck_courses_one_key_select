# fuck_courses_one_key_select

This is a course_select_system. Due to a lot of consideration, the code is open source.

This project is develped based on [sustc_framework](https://github.com/BorisChenCZY/sustc_framework)

A few moer things need to be done in the near(?) future:

- rewrite in SVM model.
- use database to speed up query.
- add more complex token verify system.

Code by Boris.
Star if you like it.
